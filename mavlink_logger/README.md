# Mavlink Logger

The `mavlink_logger` crate provides a simple interface for logging mavlink messages to a file.

Simple rotating file mavlink based logging system.

## Documentation

Simple API documentation can be found inline and through the autogenerated rust docs. More complex concepts can be found in the /docs folder as markdown files. These are also included in the cargo docs.

## Future Work

- use rust features to select for certain optimizations such as no timestamps or mavlink only
- support no copy logging if possible and necessary
- add support for logging in embedded systems
